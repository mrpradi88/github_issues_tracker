Discription:-
This is the simple application which will give us functionality to track the public projects issues according to dates.

Implementation:-
This application is implemented in Node.js,Express.js,Angular.js,Bootstrap and with some other utility modules with Node.js
Here am not using any api(library) to communicate with GitHub but i have used REST URL to communicate with Git by some request module.

It is not a fully fledged application but required functionality is working fine.
